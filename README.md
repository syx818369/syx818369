Hello, everyone！
    My name is Song Yaxuan. I come  from Class 2, Grade 21 Financial Technology. I'm  today's speaker. The theme of my speech today is My Role in Building a Community with a Shared Future.
    When I was a kid, I guess I'm haven't made up my mind. because I only knew how to play and had no idea about building a community. So I  going as a children.
    When I was in high school, Some people say that you are just a student. you can only stay in school and have classes. emm...Yeah, I guess so. Besides studying hard, I don't know what I can do. So I going as a middle student.
    But then, as a college student, We have more patterns and opportunities. We need to have a great ambition and ideal. Set our own goals.
    In the pass,I might say, I want to get out and see the world. But I think this won't happen for a while. So we need to start with the little things around us. We can spare time to do some volunteer activities.
    For example, in this summer vacation, I went to my community neighborhood, to do some services, visit the elderly and learn about people's living conditions.
      I learned that it takes everyone to build a loving and warm community. So I going as a builder. It's hard to give, but it's not that hard. Nothing is impossible as long as we all work together. I believe our community  will be better and better.
    That all,thank you！
